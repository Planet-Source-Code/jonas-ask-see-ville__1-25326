### Description

See Ville is a city simulator, much like Sim City (The good o'll one). to put it short;

- It's Bigish

- It's Bugish

- It's Messy

- and it's FAAAAR form complete <g>

Far, far, far from done... Only residental buildings are compelted, and MANY importaint functions are still missing (some because I can't figure out how to do it). Eventhough, I thought I would share it with the VB comunity, and get som feedback :)

P.S. If anybody have a good idea on how to distribuate the citizens over all the res. buildings, get i touch with me, please, it's hard! ;)
 
### More Info
 
I had to remove all the bmps to upload it, sorry
